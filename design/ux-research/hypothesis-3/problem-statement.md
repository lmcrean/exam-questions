## The Unified Teacher Scenario

**Context:** Secondary school teacher managing both daily formative assessment (starters, quick checks) AND summative assessment (coursework, data drops) with 90-330 students.

**Current Reality:**
- **For daily starters:** Use paper or Mentimeter (limited to short answers, no marking integration)
- **For data drops:** Manual marking taking 55+ hours
- **The problem:** Two completely separate workflows with no shared infrastructure

**The Inefficiency:**
- Tools for engagement (Mentimeter) ≠ Tools for assessment (manual marking)
- Quick formative checks can't easily become graded assessments
- Can't reuse student work from starters for marking purposes
- Constantly context-switching between different tools

---

## Core Problem: The Assessment Workflow is Broken

### The Pain Point

**"I use Mentimeter for engaging starters, but when I need to actually mark work, I'm back to spending 55+ hours manually grading 330 students."**

**What this means:**
- **Fragmentation:** Daily formative tools (Mentimeter, Kahoot) are separate from summative assessment tools (Google Classroom, paper marking)
- **Lack of flexibility:** Can't turn a starter question into a graded assessment on the fly
- **No continuity:** Student responses from formative checks are lost (not saved for later grading)
- **Rigid workflows:** Must decide upfront: "Is this graded?" (can't change mind later)
- **Time waste:** Setting up Mentimeter for starters, then setting up separate marking workflow for assessments

### Why This Matters

**For the Teacher:**

**Daily workflow pain:**
- Mentimeter/Kahoot are great for engagement but limited:
  - Character limits (200-500 chars) prevent exam-style questions
  - No marking integration
  - Can't spot detailed patterns in long-form responses
  - Can't turn starter responses into graded work
- Can't use the same tool for both starters and summative assessment
- Must learn and maintain multiple tools (Mentimeter + Google Classroom + marking workflow)

**Marking workflow pain:**
- 55+ hours marking 330 students for data drops
- Delayed feedback (1-2 weeks)
- No AI assistance for repetitive marking tasks
- Can't identify patterns across large volumes quickly

**The underlying issue:**
- Tools for **engagement** ≠ Tools for **assessment**
- Need one flexible platform that handles both seamlessly

**For Students:**
- Starters feel disconnected from summative assessment
- No continuity: "We did this in the starter, why are we doing it again for homework?"
- Can't see their progress from formative → summative
- Delayed feedback on graded work (1-2 weeks)

---

## Current Solutions and Their Limitations

### Solution 1: Mentimeter / Kahoot / Wooclap (For Starters)

**What works:**
- ✅ Real-time engagement
- ✅ Live display on board
- ✅ Fun, interactive
- ✅ Word clouds, voting

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ **Character limits** (can't do exam-style questions requiring 500+ words)
- ❌ **No marking integration** (can't turn responses into grades)
- ❌ **No detailed feedback** (can't provide WWW/EBI per student)
- ❌ **Short-lived** (responses disappear after session, no record)
- ❌ **Not designed for assessment** (no rubric, no mark scheme)

**Teacher Quote:**
> "Mentimeter is great for quick polls, but I can't use it for real exam practice that requires marking. So I end up using it for 10 minutes at the start, then switching to paper for the actual assessment work."

---

### Solution 2: Manual Marking + Google Classroom (For Summative)

**What works:**
- ✅ Can handle complex coursework
- ✅ Teacher control over grading
- ✅ Export grades

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ **55+ hours marking** for 330 students
- ❌ **No AI assistance** (every response manually read)
- ❌ **Feedback delayed** 1-2 weeks
- ❌ **Not engaging** (students just submit and wait)
- ❌ **No peer learning** (responses are private)
- ❌ **Separate from formative tools** (can't reuse starter questions)

**Teacher Quote:**
> "I love using Mentimeter for engagement, but when it comes to actual data drops, I'm stuck manually marking for hours. Why can't the same tool do both?"

---

### Solution 3: Paper-Based Workflow

**What works:**
- ✅ Fast setup
- ✅ Authentic to exam format
- ✅ No tech dependency

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ **No pattern-spotting** across 30 responses
- ❌ **55+ hours manual marking** for data drops
- ❌ **No engagement features** (can't display all responses, no voting)
- ❌ **No instant feedback** (must mark all books manually)
- ❌ **Inconsistent** (marking drift over multiple days)

---

## The Real Competition: Duct-Taping Multiple Tools

Let's be honest: the main alternative is **using multiple fragmented tools**:

**Current teacher workflow:**
1. **Starters:** Mentimeter/Kahoot (5-10 min)
2. **Formative practice:** Paper + verbal sharing (20-30 min)
3. **Summative assessment:** Google Classroom submission (homework)
4. **Marking:** Manual (55+ hours)
5. **Feedback:** Google Classroom comments (1-2 weeks later)

**Why teachers stick with this fragmented approach:**
- Each tool does *one thing* well
- No single tool does *everything* well
- Switching costs (learning new platforms)
- "Good enough" (even if inefficient)

**What would make a teacher switch to a unified platform:**
- **Flexibility:** Same tool for starters AND data drops (context-switch-free)
- **Seamless workflow:** Student work from starter can become graded assessment (dynamic decision-making)
- **AI marking:** Reduce 55 hours → <10 hours for summative assessment
- **Engagement:** Live display, voting, peer learning (better than Mentimeter for exam questions)
- **No character limits:** Handle long-form exam-style responses
- **One login, one tool:** Reduce cognitive load of maintaining multiple platforms

## Desired Outcomes

### For Teachers

**Primary:**
1. **One tool for all assessment types**
   - Daily starters (formative, quick checks)
   - Weekly exam practice (formative with optional marking)
   - Termly data drops (summative, graded)
   - No need to context-switch between Mentimeter + Google Classroom + manual marking

2. **Flexible, dynamic workflow**
   - Students submit responses
   - Teacher decides *after* submission: "Should I grade this? Display it live? Enable peer review?"
   - Can turn a starter into a graded assessment retroactively
   - Can reuse questions across formative → summative

3. **Time savings on marking**
   - AI marks coursework (reduces 55 hours → <10 hours)
   - Instant feedback to students (no 1-2 week delay)
   - Consistent grading across 330 students

4. **Pattern-spotting for formative assessment**
   - See all 30 starter responses at a glance
   - AI highlights common misconceptions
   - Spot patterns faster than reading notebooks

**Secondary:**
5. Reduce number of tools to learn/maintain (one platform, not three)
6. Student engagement through live display + peer review
7. Data continuity (all student work in one place, not fragmented)

### For Students

**Primary:**
1. **Continuity between formative and summative**
   - Starter practice → graded assessment (same platform, same UX)
   - Progress tracked in one place

2. **Instant feedback**
   - Receive WWW/EBI immediately (not 1-2 weeks later)
   - Learn from mistakes while content is fresh

3. **Peer learning**
   - See peer responses during starters
   - Compare own work to others
   - Vote on strong examples

**Secondary:**
4. Less friction (same login, same interface for all assignments)
5. More engaging than paper (live display, voting)

## Success Criteria

**The solution is working if:**

1. **Teachers use it for multiple assessment types**
   - Same tool used for starters AND data drops (not just one or the other)
   - Evidence: 70%+ of teachers use it at least weekly (starters) AND at least once per term (data drops)

2. **Flexibility is utilized**
   - Teachers make *post-submission* decisions ("Let's grade this starter") at least 20% of the time
   - Evidence: "Dynamic grading" feature is used, not just pre-planned assessments

3. **Time savings on marking**
   - 80%+ reduction in marking time for data drops (55 hours → <10 hours)
   - 85%+ AI accuracy (teacher trusts grades for official reporting)

4. **Better than Mentimeter for exam questions**
   - Teachers prefer this over Mentimeter for long-form starter questions
   - No character limit complaints
   - Evidence: 70%+ say "This is better than Mentimeter for exam practice"

5. **One tool replaces three**
   - Teachers stop using Mentimeter + Google Classroom + manual marking
   - Evidence: Platform becomes primary assessment tool (not supplement)

**The solution is failing if:**

- Teachers only use it for starters OR marking (not both)
- "Dynamic grading" feature is ignored (teachers still plan upfront)
- AI marking is inaccurate (teachers must manually re-mark everything)
- Teachers keep using Mentimeter because this tool isn't as good
- Too complex (learning curve outweighs benefits)

## Open Questions for Research

Before building, validate:

1. **Do teachers value "dynamic" decision-making?**
   - How often do teachers wish they could "make this graded" after seeing responses?
   - Or do they always know upfront whether something will be graded?

2. **Is "one tool for everything" compelling?**
   - Do teachers want unified platform? Or prefer specialized tools?
   - Is "one login" a significant benefit?

3. **Can AI work for both quick starters AND detailed coursework?**
   - Same AI model handle 50-word starter + 500-word essay?
   - Does mark scheme complexity differ enough to require separate flows?

4. **Will teachers trust AI for both formative and summative?**
   - Lower trust threshold for starters (low stakes)
   - Higher trust threshold for data drops (high stakes)
   - Can one accuracy level satisfy both?

5. **Does continuity between formative → summative add value?**
   - Do students benefit from "starter → assessment" progression?
   - Or are they mentally separate workflows?

6. **Would teachers pay more for an all-in-one platform?**
   - Premium pricing justified by replacing multiple tools?
   - Or expect same price as specialized tools?

## Hypothesis to Test

**"If teachers had one flexible tool that handled both engaging starters (like Mentimeter) and AI-assisted marking (for data drops), they would use it daily for formative assessment and termly for summative assessment, replacing 3 separate tools."**

**Key Assumptions to Test:**
1. Teachers want one unified tool (not specialized tools)
2. Flexibility to "decide later" is valuable (not just pre-planned workflows)
3. AI accuracy can satisfy both low-stakes starters and high-stakes marking
4. Better than Mentimeter for exam-style questions (no character limits)
5. Time savings on data drops justifies adoption
6. Daily formative use drives retention between data drop cycles

## How to Test Before Building

### Test 1: Wizard of Oz for Starters (Like Hypothesis 1)
- Use Wooclap for exam-style starter questions (long-form, no character limit)
- Display all responses on board
- Enable peer voting
- Ask: "Is this better than Mentimeter for exam practice?"

### Test 2: Wizard of Oz for Marking (Like Hypothesis 2)
- Manually "simulate" AI marking (consistent rubric application)
- Provide instant WWW/EBI feedback
- Track time saved vs. manual marking
- Ask: "Would you trust these grades for data drops?"

### Test 3: The "Dynamic" Workflow (Unique to Hypothesis 3)
- Run a starter with a teacher (don't mention grading)
- After responses submitted, ask: "Do you want to grade this retroactively?"
- Observe: Do they utilize flexibility? Or irrelevant?
- Ask: "Would you use this 'decide later' feature regularly?"

### Test 4: "One Tool" Value Prop
- Interview 10 teachers: "Would you prefer one tool for all assessment, or specialized tools for each type?"
- Ask: "How much friction is there maintaining 3 separate tools (Mentimeter + GC + marking)?"
- Listen for: "I wish I could use one login" vs. "I like specialized tools"

## The Real Pain vs. Nice-to-Have

**Real Pain (worth solving):**
- ❌ 55+ hours marking for data drops (teacher pain)
- ❌ Mentimeter can't handle exam-style questions (teacher pain)
- ❌ Context-switching between multiple tools (teacher pain)
- ❌ Can't turn starters into graded assessments easily (teacher pain)
- ❌ Feedback delayed 1-2 weeks (student pain)
- ❌ No pattern-spotting for formative assessment (teacher pain)

**Nice-to-Have (engagement, not pain):**
- Data continuity (all in one place)
- Progress tracking across formative → summative
- Unified student experience

**Critical Insight: Is "One Tool" the Core Value?**

The question is: **Do teachers value "all-in-one" enough to switch?**

- If YES → Build unified platform (Hypothesis 3)
- If NO → Build specialized tools (Hypothesis 1 or 2, prioritize based on pain)

**Build for the pain (marking time + pattern-spotting), test if "one tool" adds value.**

## Critical Question: What's the Real Differentiator?

**Three possible core value props:**

1. **"Better Mentimeter"** (Hypothesis 1 focus)
   - Solves: Character limits, pattern-spotting
   - Doesn't solve: Marking time (biggest pain)

2. **"AI Marking Assistant"** (Hypothesis 2 focus)
   - Solves: 55+ hours marking (biggest pain)
   - Doesn't solve: Daily formative engagement

3. **"All-in-One Assessment Platform"** (Hypothesis 3 focus)
   - Solves: Context-switching, flexibility, marking time, engagement
   - Risk: Jack of all trades, master of none?

**The test:** Which headline resonates most with teachers?
- A: "Mentimeter for exam questions"
- B: "AI cuts marking time by 80%"
- C: "One tool for all your assessments"

**Hypothesis 3 is viable if teachers value "C" enough to switch from A+B separately.**
